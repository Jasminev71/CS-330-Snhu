REFLECTION 
1. How do I approach designing software?
For my project, I focused on designing a 3D birthday party scene that included objects like a table, balloons, cake, and presents. I used iterative design, starting with simple shapes and then refining them with scale, rotation, and textures. The biggest design skill I developed was learning how to balance multiple objects and textures so the scene felt cohesive. This process taught me how to break a complex project into smaller tasks, which is something I can apply to future software projects as well.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
When developing my scene, I used incremental development. I built one object at a time, tested it, and then layered in new features like colors and textures. Iteration played a significant role â€” for example, I adjusted object placement multiple times to avoid clipping and to make the layout look realistic.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Working on this project showed me how computer graphics can be both creative and technical. By learning how to visualize 3D objects and interactions, I gained skills that connect directly to data visualization and other areas I want to pursue in computer science. Creating interactive and visually responsive scenes helps me see how programming can turn abstract concepts into something tangible, which will be valuable both in my education and in my professional goals.
