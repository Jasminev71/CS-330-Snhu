REFLECTION 
1. How do I approach designing software?
For my project, I focused on designing a 3D birthday party scene that included objects like a table, balloons, cake, and presents. I used iterative design, starting with simple shapes and then refining them with scale, rotation, and textures. The biggest design skill I developed was learning how to balance multiple objects and textures so the scene felt cohesive. This process taught me how to break a complex project into smaller tasks, which is something I can apply to future software projects as well.
